        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">SOLUTION</h6>
        <h6>We redesigned the home screen to encompass a new featured section and revamped category selection. The new home screen promotes more discoverability for the user curated by our in-house team to bring our customers closer to relevant content.<br><br>We also reworked a less-cluttered home screen on our mobile app by adopting a flatter UI which will bring our app to modern design standards.</h6>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">APPROACH</h6>
        <h6>We collaborated with the sales team, product managers, and key Reebee stakeholders to decide on the best way to highlight our retailers in our app and define the blockers for users to get the content they want. <br><br>I used this segway as an opportunity to push for a refresh of the Reebee app design, which hadn't been updated in over five years at the time of this project.</h6>

    <h2>01. Understand and develop a strategy</h2>
    <h6>To get onboarded onto the project, I started by understanding the company‚Äôs product roadmap and the primary motivations behind the project.</h6>

    <h4><b>Stakeholder Interviews</b></h4>
    <img class="image" src="assets/homeredesign-case/cofounders.png">

    <h6>I met with my stakeholders, Reebee co-founders Tobiasz and Michael, to learn which teams were involved in the project, the existing revenue streams for the business, and the metrics of success.</h6>

    <h4><b>User Interviews</b></h4>
    <img class="image" src="assets/homeredesign-case/userinterview.png">
    <h6>As part of my discovery, I interviewed users who were using Reebee for the first time, those who used Reebee once a week, and those who used Reebee multiple times a week and asked for their impression of the previous home screen design.</h6>

    <h4><b>Sales Team Interviews</b></h4>
    <h6>Lastly, I also spoke with our sales team to identify problem areas or places for improvement our retailers have targeted and the features they‚Äôd like to see in our app to identify where I could design for both business and user.<br><br>
      Since we primarily display the content of our retailers in our app, our sales team was the best source to understand the retailer‚Äôs perspective. This was a good starting point to exploring how we could use screen estate to exhibit their weekly content.

            <h4>Research Insights</h4>
            <h6><b>WHAT</b></h6>
            <h6>
  The previous home screen design was <b>underwhelming</b> and <b>offered no sense of hierarchy</b> for flyers to our users. Users expect the home screen to be designed for discovering new content, and browsing aimlessly without much cognitive load.<br><br>Our stakeholders wanted to transition to be more brand-focused rather than flyer-focused if we wanted to <b>distinguish ourselves from competitors</b>.<br><br>
  In our market research, our previous design lacked the <b>modern styles of newer apps</b>.
</h6>

  <h6><b>HOW</b></h6>
  <h6>Redesign the app, starting with the home screen, to give a more modern look that reduces distractions for the readers and entices through improved visual and aims to give more guidance to a user's next steps.</h6>

  <h6><b>WHY</b></h6>
  <h6><i>For the business</i><br>
  Increases user engagement and be more competitive<br><br>

  <i>For the user</i><br>
  Delivers the same intuitive navigational patterns,but  minimizes interruptions that comes with cluttered UI components</h6>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h6><b>Changed the grey background to white</b></h6>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h6><b>Increased flyer size and added shadows</b></h6>

  <h2>Looking back</h2>
  <h6>This project was a great opportunity for me to design for business needs and work on my prototyping to motivate and empower the company to develop a more design-oriented product.

<br><br>Throughout the process, I got to speak to all levels of the company to learn about the decisions behind every feature and embrace my vulnerability to ask more questions. Reebee gave me levels of ownership I didn‚Äôt expect to achieve as a young designer and allowed me to create an experience that let my visual design and interaction design skills shine through.

<br><br><b>Next steps</b> - Reebee is working with retailers to create the right artwork to display in our featured section and exploring more ways to modernize the design of the rest of the app to complement the home screen.</h6>
