      <h2>Design challenge</h2>
      <h6 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;">How might we adapt and enhance the digital reading experience of Microsoft News using a dual screen device?</h6>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-body">
  <div class="row" style="margin-top: 50px;">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6 style="font-weight:700;">SOLUTION</h6>
      <h6>Looking at the existing Android app for Microsoft News, we transferred the core functionality of the app (e.g. browsing articles, reading article, saving stories) to fit the Surface Duo.<br><br>

To take it one step further, our team implemented Surface Duo-specific features available for Microsoft News to get more users on the device and make use of the second screen.</h6>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6 style="font-weight:700;">CONSTRAINTS</h6>
      <h6>Dual screen technology and design is a limited field of resources, and we weren’t sure what to expect when it came to user behaviour.<br><br>

Microsoft News is a long-existing brand within Microsoft and we had to adhere to a specific brand and design system in place to keep it consistent with the existing product on web and single screen mobile.</h6>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">SOLUTION</h6>
        <h6>We redesigned the home screen to encompass a new featured section and revamped category selection. The new home screen promotes more discoverability for the user curated by our in-house team to bring our customers closer to relevant content.<br><br>We also reworked a less-cluttered home screen on our mobile app by adopting a flatter UI which will bring our app to modern design standards.</h6>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">APPROACH</h6>
        <h6>We collaborated with the sales team, product managers, and key Reebee stakeholders to decide on the best way to highlight our retailers in our app and define the blockers for users to get the content they want. <br><br>I used this project as an opportunity to refresh Reebee's app design, which hadn't been updated in five years at the time.</h6>
      </div>
    </div> -->
    <div class="content-body">
    <h2>Here's how we did it</h2>
    <h6>As we started working on the project back in January 2020, there were many unknowns coming from both design and development.

<br><br>In comparison to foldable screens, Surface Duo offers two sets of information on two separate screens for multi-tasking, which produces various design patterns to connect the content.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>How do people's <b>mental models of single screen device</b> usage carry over to dual screens?<br>
<li>How does the Surface Duo's <b>center hinge</b> affect how the human brain interprets the content?<br>
<li>How much should be defined as a system default versus <b>how much interface control</b> should be allocated to users?<br>
<li>How will we <b>educate users</b> on Duo-specific gestures and interactions?</h6>
</ul>
    </div>

  <div class="gray-highlight-section">

      <h2>Principles of dual-screen design</h2>
      <h4><b>01.</b> Deliver an intuitive pattern in its native environment</h4>
      <h4><b>02.</b> Emphasize function over form</h4>
      <h4><b>03.</b> Orient content with context where needed</h4>
      <h4><b>04.</b> Recognize interdependence</h4>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-body">
    <h2>Design process framework</h2>
    <h6>From there, we created a framework for our design process to think about as we brought news reading to dual screens. We hope our approach will help others navigate this new paradigm and encourage you to build upon our work!</h6>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 200px;">Newsfeed</h1>
      <h6>The newsfeed is a high visibility feature of Microsoft News, offering a simple, stress free browsing experience. Readers use it as a starting point in our app to navigate further between features and explore the flow.</h6>
    </div>
  </div>

    <!-- <h6>I met with my stakeholders, Reebee co-founders Tobiasz and Michael, to learn which teams were involved in the project, the existing revenue streams for the business, and the metrics of success.</h6>

    <h4><b>User Interviews</b></h4>
    <img class="image" src="assets/homeredesign-case/userinterview.png">
    <h6>As part of my discovery, I interviewed users who were using Reebee for the first time, those who used Reebee once a week, and those who used Reebee multiple times a week and asked for their impression of the previous home screen design.</h6>

    <h4><b>Sales Team Interviews</b></h4>
    <h6>Lastly, I also spoke with our sales team to identify problem areas or places for improvement our retailers have targeted and the features they’d like to see in our app to identify where I could design for both business and user.<br><br>
      Since we primarily display the content of our retailers in our app, our sales team was the best source to understand the retailer’s perspective. This was a good starting point to exploring how we could use screen estate to exhibit their weekly content.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%;">Final strategy</h2>
    <h6>As our app grows in content and consumers are overloaded with choices, the ability to find and access the right content people want to read becomes farther. To reduce that time to goal, I based my strategy on redesigning the home screen to deliver with the following key elements.</h6>

            <h4>Research Insights</h4>
            <h6><b>WHAT</b></h6>
            <h6>
  The previous home screen design was <b>underwhelming</b> and <b>offered no sense of hierarchy</b> for flyers to our users. Users expect the home screen to be designed for discovering new content, and browsing aimlessly without much cognitive load.<br><br>Our stakeholders wanted to transition to be more brand-focused rather than flyer-focused if we wanted to <b>distinguish ourselves from competitors</b>.<br><br>
  In our market research, our previous design lacked the <b>modern styles of newer apps</b>.
</h6>

  <h6><b>HOW</b></h6>
  <h6>Redesign the app, starting with the home screen, to give a more modern look that reduces distractions and aims to give more guidance to next steps.</h6>

  <h6><b>WHY</b></h6>
  <h6><i>For the business</i><br>
  Increases user engagement and be more competitive<br><br>

  <i>For the user</i><br>
  Delivers the same intuitive navigational patterns,but  minimizes interruptions that comes with cluttered UI components</h6>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h6><b>Changed the grey background to white</b></h6>
            <h6>White allowed us to introduce more prominent shadows and really highlight the content our users came for: the flyers. The white background accentuated the flyer which is catered for both user and retailer.</h6>

  <h2>Looking back</h2>
  <h6>This project was a great opportunity for me to design for business needs and work on my prototyping to motivate and empower the company to develop a more design-oriented product.

<br><br>Throughout the process, I got to speak to all levels of the company to learn about the decisions behind every feature and embrace my vulnerability to ask more questions. Reebee gave me levels of ownership I didn’t expect to achieve as a young designer and allowed me to create an experience that let my visual design and interaction design skills shine through.
