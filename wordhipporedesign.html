							<h1><center>Word Hippo Redesign</center></h1>
							<h4><center>UI Design Inspiration of the Week</br>By Judy Zhong</center></h4>
							<p><center>May 21, 2018</center></p>
							
							<p><a href="https://www.wordhippo.com">Word Hippo</a> is an online service I use regularly to generate synonyms and antonyms for things like cover letters, newspaper articles, and school reports. I've been using the site for a few years now and I thought the UI could use a little change up so I did this redesign as my inspiration for this week. The gradient background was created on Adobe Illustrator and the site was made in Sketch. The above is their rebuffed landing page and below is the screen for when someone searches up synonyms to the word "design".</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>The main reason I looked to redesigning their interface it that I frequently use their services and I know that the constraints I experience with it are definitely discouraging for me to keep using it. For example, the page does not create a good flow for users and if I did not use the site regularly, I would find it difficult to get to the first task users would go to once they get to the site: searching for a word. In my redesign I made the search bar the main focus of the page. On their site they have two areas in which users can select the action they wish for the search they search up, whether it is a synonym, something that rhymes with the word, sentences with, etc. </br></br>The first part, which I've never touched, is the tabs on the top part of the screen with 9 different actions. The second is the dropdown menu where it says "Select option" and it presents completely different options, and many more. This may confuse a user such as myself and create a lot more friction. THe main purpose of the site is for people to use it quickly, they are looking for a new word quick and don't have time for all the extra functions and searching for those functions. I put the tabs on mine right above the search part, with much larger buttons that diminishes the work done on the user side creating better accessibility overall.</p>
