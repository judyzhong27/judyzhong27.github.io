							<h4><center>UI Design Inspiration of the Week</center></h4>
							<p><a href="https://www.wordhippo.com">Word Hippo</a> is an online service I use regularly to generate synonyms and antonyms for things like cover letters, newspaper articles, and school reports. I've been using the site for a few years now and I thought the UI could use a little change up so I did this redesign as my inspiration for this week. The gradient background was created on Adobe Illustrator and the site was made in Sketch.</p>

							<h2>Work Experience</h2>
							<p>Experiences shape who we are and push us that much further into what we wish to become outside the classroom. Each experience has given me the skills I need to pursue bigger and better things for myself in the industry and taught me that wherever I go, I must go with professionalism and confidence in myself and my abilities.</p>

									<h3>Figma</h3>
									<p>I used Figma the web app and Figma Mirror to create an iPhone X prototype of Snack Overflow. Initially I used Sketch for the iOS UI Design elements but decided to import into Figma to implement the connections I wanted between screens in the prototype, which can be seen through this <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RLoa7kbuzLilThB64E061CNx/snackoverflow">link</a></p>
