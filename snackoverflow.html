							<h1>Snack Overflow: A Case Study</h1>
							<h4>By Judy Zhong</h4>
							<h3></br>Introduction</h3>
							<p><span style="color:#2997DF;">Snack Overflow</span> was created in February of 2018 at the second annual Hack the Valley hackathon at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus. The premise was to create something that could benefit society and reduce humanity's environmental impact. My team of four with myself as the designer worked tirelessly for 36 hours on an iOS app called <span style="color:#2997DF;">Snack Overflow</span> to target the issue of food waste in the world. We proposed a live app that gave real-time notifications on nearby sales happening at grocery stores looking to get rid of nearly expired foods at a discounted price as a way to start the conversation on food waste and diminish its numbers.</p>

							<h2>Problem Space</h2>
							<p>Every year, 1/3 of the food produced for human consumption never reaches the consumer's table. That is over 1.3 billion tonnes of lost or discarded food items that contributes to poor environmental management and copious amounts of natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, and transporting the item are wasted. 1.3 billion tonnes would be enough to feed 2 million people. Unsurprisingly, this volume of food wastage can be seen at its highest in higher income countries at the processing, distribution, and consumption stages. In lower income countries, this issue can be seen more in production as they have access to less secure farming methods with the lack of proper infrastructure and knowledge on the proper storage and handling of food.

							</br></br>Environmentally, the carbon footprint of food production is massive, the most being produced the farther along the production it is. For example, a single tomato that spoils at the harvesting stage has a far smaller footprint than a can of tomatoes at the grocery store if you account for the processing and transportation it took to get there. Since higher income countries have a much higher percentage of food wastage at the consumption level they generate the greatest amount of GHG emissions in a year at nearly 20%.

							</br></br>A lot of this food waste can be caused by factors such as the purchase and prepartion of too much food, leading to an excess as leftovers and partially used food is more often than not discarded as waste. Perhaps you've got a a bag of moldy apples in the back of your fridge or an expired half-full tub of yogurt in your fridge right now.</p>

							<h2></br>The Product View</h2>
							<p>The Snack Overflow mobile application acts to diminish the levels of food waste in higher income countries such as Canada, as they are the biggest contributors of the volume wasted at the consumption stage. Snack Overflow serves as a central location for grocery stores to send notifications of flash sales to consumers in the area to tell them of deals on food items, whether because they are about to expire and be thrown out, or the store needs to clear out some inventory to make room for new shipments. The consumers would be able to view the app and search by: </br></br>- Grocery stores near them</br>- Whether they are looking for a specific food item (produce, vegetables, wheat, meat, dairy)</br>- Deals ending that day</p>

							<p>The opening screen takes the user directly to their login, which will keep track of their email for updates and allow them to personalize the deals and stores they wish to see most often. Once they login they are taken to the initial function which is to search for what they'd like. For quick usability, on the main screen I also included their saved grocery stores appearing as cards which in the HFP, I would want to implement a scrolling right function for that half of the screen if they have more 4-5 grocery stores saved. On the top right of each screen there will also be a notification button, red when there is something they haven't looked at with the option to click there to see them. Additionally, for enhanced accessibility they can access it through the hamburger menu on the top left and see notifications as the first option.</p>

							<p>In each grocery store's screen, the main colour will be the main colour of their branding. The example I've included is Loblaws, whose logo colour is HEX #FF0000 and all the elements on the page pertain to that colour, including the icons. Once again, the hamburger menu and notifications button can be seen her on the top bar, with the store name in clear white letters. Above that users are given 3 options: search store items, locate the store on a map, and favourite the store to add it to the main screen. Below that, the news of flash sales are listed and can be filtered according to vegetables, dairy, fruit, meat, and wheat which can be selected from the top of the list. To indicate selection, the icon gets coloured in.</p>

							<h2></br>Persona Mapping (User Research)</h2>
							<p>This app is designed with the main audience of North American households in mind, likely with a car and a smartphone. They grocery shop biweekly and more often than not, buy in excess and regularly have to toss out the uneaten bread loaf or the rotting ball of cabbage.</p>
