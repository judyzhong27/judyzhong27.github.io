                            	<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
                                <p>Every year, a third of the food produced for human consumption never reaches the dinner table. That equates to over 1.3 billion tonnes of lost or discard food items, significantly contributing to poor environmental management and copious amounts of natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, and transporting the items are wasted. 1.3 billion tonnes would be enough to feed 2 million people. Unsurprsingly, this volume of food wastage is seen at its highest in the wealthier countries at the processing, distribution, and consumption stages. In lower income countries, it occurs more frequently in the production stages due to inaccessibility to less secure farming methods, lack of proper infrastructure, and absence of knowledge on proper storage and handling of food.</p>                                
                                <br><br>
                                <h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
                                <p>The carbon footprint of food production is massive, which only increases at every stage of food production. For example, a single tomato that spoils at the harvesting stage has a far smaller footprint than a can of tomatoes expiring at the grocery store if you account for the processing and transportation it took to get there. Since higher income countries tend to have a much higher percentage of food wastage at the consumption level, they generate the greatest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in a single year at 20%.<br><br>
                                A lot of this food waste can be caused by factors such as the purchase and prepartion of too much food, leading to excess leftovers and partially used food that is more often than not discarded as waste. This irresponsible behaviour with food has been a significant problem in our society due to ignorance.

                                <p>Snack Overflow is a mobile app that aims to diminish the levels of food waste in higher income countries, as they are the biggest contributors. Snack Overflow serves as a central platform for grocery stores to send notifications of flash sales to consumers in the area to tell them about deals on food items, whether because they are about to expire, be thrown out, or the store lacks the space to store them. The consumers would be able</p><br>
