      <h2>Design challenge</h2>
      <h6 style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;">How might we adapt and enhance the digital reading experience of Microsoft News using a dual screen device?</h6>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-body">
  <div class="row" style="margin-top: 50px;">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6 style="font-weight:700;">SOLUTION</h6>
      <h6>Looking at the existing Android app for Microsoft News, we transferred the core functionality of the app (e.g. browsing articles, reading article, saving stories) to fit the Surface Duo.<br><br>

To take it one step further, our team implemented Surface Duo-specific features available for Microsoft News to get more users on the device and make use of the second screen.</h6>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6 style="font-weight:700;">CONSTRAINTS</h6>
      <h6>Dual screen technology and design is a limited field of resources, and we weren’t sure what to expect when it came to user behaviour.<br><br>

Microsoft News is a long-existing brand within Microsoft and we had to adhere to a specific brand and design system in place to keep it consistent with the existing product on web and single screen mobile.</h6>
    </div>

    <!-- <div class="row" style="margin-top: 50px;">

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">SOLUTION</h6>
        <h6>We redesigned the home screen to encompass a new featured section and revamped category selection. The new home screen promotes more discoverability for the user curated by our in-house team to bring our customers closer to relevant content.<br><br>We also reworked a less-cluttered home screen on our mobile app by adopting a flatter UI which will bring our app to modern design standards.</h6>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h6 style="font-weight:700;">APPROACH</h6>
        <h6>We collaborated with the sales team, product managers, and key Reebee stakeholders to decide on the best way to highlight our retailers in our app and define the blockers for users to get the content they want. <br><br>I used this project as an opportunity to refresh Reebee's app design, which hadn't been updated in five years at the time.</h6>
      </div>
    </div> -->
    <div class="content-body">
    <h2>Here's how we did it</h2>
    <h6>As we started working on the project back in January 2020, there were many unknowns coming from both design and development.

<br><br>In comparison to foldable screens, Surface Duo offers two sets of information on two separate screens for multi-tasking, which produces various design patterns to connect the content.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>How do people's <b>mental models of single screen device</b> usage carry over to dual screens?<br>
<li>How does the Surface Duo's <b>center hinge</b> affect how the human brain interprets the content?<br>
<li>How much should be defined as a system default versus <b>how much interface control</b> should be allocated to users?<br>
<li>How will we <b>educate users</b> on Duo-specific gestures and interactions?</h6>
</ul>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">The Microsoft News team on the project</h6>
<img class="image" src="assets/news-case/teampic.jpg">

<h6>This project was an opportunity not only to elevate the Microsoft News' reading experience, but to define new standards when it came to dual screen design. We were one of the first teams to tackle such a challenge, we knew our work would be looked at and critiqued by incoming teams shifting their work to dual screens. <br><br>We sought to set patterns, maybe even break them, establish best practices, document our knowledge for others, create expectations with our functionality, and be a benchmark to other apps entering the space.</h6>

      <h2>Principles of dual-screen design</h2>
      <h4><b>01.</b> Deliver an intuitive pattern in its native environment</h4>
      <h4><b>02.</b> Emphasize function over form</h4>
      <h4><b>03.</b> Orient content with context where needed</h4>
      <h4><b>04.</b> Recognize interdependence</h4>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-body">
    <h2>Design process framework</h2>
    <h6>From there, we created a framework for our design process to think about as we brought news reading to dual screens. We hope our approach will help others navigate this new paradigm and encourage you to build upon our work!</h6>
    <h6>A unique, notable aspect of this project was the way we measured success. My design process wasn't driven by the same metrics as Microsoft News (revenue, articles read, time spent on app) but rather focused on not disconnecting the experience our existing users were familiar with, and showcasing value for dual screen app experiences. This ended up being a big factor in all my design decisions and iterations.</h6>

    <h2>Evolving from my single screen process and mindset</h2>
    <h6>As the sole designer on the project, I made a lot of mistakes when it came to navigating this landscape. The external resources on dual screen design were scarce, and the Surface Duo's behaviour and research was a black box under strict privacy concerns for this new product.</h6>
    <h6>Here are some of the process adaptations I had to make to fit the unique nature of this project</h6>

        <h6><i>Specific to project</i><br><br>The developers and designers <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">worked synchronously</span> for this project. We were all exploring this uncharted territory together, so I <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">leaned on them to validate my initial assumptions</span> as "users" as we began to define mental models of dual screen usage.</h6>
      </div>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
      <h6><i>Specific to project</i><br><br>In comparison to my previous work, thinking through the right interactions and journeys with the second screen was quite literally <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">double the complexity</span>.<br><br>Below is an image of the 4 available device orientations on Surface Duo. Each deliverable and screen I designed had to <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">consider each mode</span>:</h6>

        <h6><i>My approach</i><br><br>Each app experience I researched began with detailed flow diagrams I could use to illustrate how the user moves between the 4 modes, which preceded any visuals or designs.<br><br>Our team wanted to solidify through testing the interactions of the app before I filled in the details. Then they were handed off in conjunction with the interaction diagrams for implementation (which can be seen later).</h6>

    <h6>Our goal was to deliver a seamless experience that demonstrated coherency between the screens, which needed to be
    incorporated into each Microsoft News experience as it would be the user's first touchpoint with dual screen technology, and we really wanted to nail it.</h6>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h6><i>Specific to project</i><br><br>Our team worked on the Surface Duo prior to its public release date, so we <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">couldn't test on non-employees</span> and were <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">limited to the number of devices</span> we could access. <br><br>The <span style="background-color: #C1EBEE">software functions and front-end gestures of the Surface Duo weren't communicated to us</span> due to privacy concerns and for the first few weeks of the project, none of us had never even used a dual screen device!</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h6><i>My approach</i><br><br>Paper prototypes were used to simulate the device's experience. We got the measurements and cut out copies of the "Surface Duo", sketching and pasting our screen designs to show our users.<br></h6>
    <h6>In conjunction with some Figma prototypes, we were able to test several different assumptions around mental models in the beginning stages of our project. Thankfully we ended up getting some real devices!</h6>

  <h2 style="margin-top:10%;">User education</h2>
  <h6>Incorporating pieces of user education into our new app experience was essential for early adoption of the Surface Duo. As the designer, I worked with other app teams such as Outlook, Teams and OneDrive
    to get inspiration and maintain consistency across onboarding experiences. Primarily, we wanted to ensure we were teaching users the correct gestures on the Surface Duo, and aligning with how best to use them
    effectively within our respective apps.<br><br>In Microsoft News, user education was built with a full screen walkthrough, multiple illustrations, empty state screens, a session with a content writer, and several tooltip drawers
    placed at our Surface Duo-specific features.</h6>

  <img src="assets/news-case/tooltip.png" alt="Mockup of tooltip drawer for Book Mode">

  <h5 class="subtitle"><b>Empty state prompts</b></h5>
  <h6>Although they look simplistic, adding these empty state prompts became a key part in communicating the best way to utilise Surface Duo for Microsoft News. Oftentimes in Spanned mode, the default would be an empty state on the other screen until the user selected to view something. <br><br>Using copy and these illustrations I created with the Microsoft illustration style guide, they're meant to guide the user and set expectations on how the second screen is meant to be used.</h6>

    <h2>What did we learn?</h2>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Keep it simple</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t stray away from pre-existing design patterns; they're backed by research!
          <li>Setting user expectations is key - the consistent choice is the better choice to build the familiarity across apps and devices
        </ul>

        <h5 class="subtitle">No *final* right or wrong answer</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>There was little opportunity to explore interactions with external users
          <li>Expectations and feature testing is ongoing with this form factor
          <li>With such new technology, there is a lot of opportunity to define new standards
        </ul>

        <h5 class="subtitle">Test everything and quantity over quality</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Our testing approach needed to be quick, and plentiful. Testing with more users to see which gestures were the most recognizable ultimately determined our direction
          <li>Sometimes even if our entire team agreed one action was the most logical, one user could quickly disprove it with their own opinion

  There are still so many possibilities when it comes to dual screen devices and I'm excited to see where teams can take it further!</h6>
