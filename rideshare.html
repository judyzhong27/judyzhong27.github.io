                                <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
                                <p>When it comes to ridesharing, solutions like Uber and Lyft have capitalized on the efficiency of their app. Between online payments and mobile booking, users can arrange rides within minutes.<br><br>

                            	For users who plan days ahead and travel longer distances, these options can be extremely costly and futile for both driver and rider. In this case, students living 1-6 hours from home to attend school. When it comes to finding rideshares to go home the occasional weekend, it can be a very frustrating and tedious task with the solutions there are now. You might spend hours chasing down non-responding drivers, unreliable riders, parsing through infinitely long Facebook posts, until you give up and take the bus. This is the case for hundreds of thousands of post-secondary students across the country who lack a single medium and established system of doing so: a system which has remained unchanged for years.<br><br>
								
								<!---To begin finding a rideshare, students commonly turn to Facebook groups comprising of thousands of old and new posts of rides from various cities, occurring at a multitude of times, different costs, with no guaranteed availability at any given moment.!--->
                                </p>

                                <h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
                                <p>Students hoping to travel between cities in Canada lack a singular platform that can help them find rides from home to school and vice versa, causing a lot of unnecessary friction when arranging transportation home and results in a lot of wasted time spent on combing through multiple platforms (Facebook, Kijiji, group chats) to find a ride. Many students prefer taking a car over the bus, but this extra strain discourages their search efforts and discourages carpooling. The needed solution should have a simple UI that allows students to quickly search for and confirm rides, include data such as cost, distance, meet up location, car type, and a method of communication for the driver and the ride.</p>

                                <p>To begin gathering data, I created an online survey with Typeform and circulated it to friends who were currently in school and whom had experience with taking a rideshare.</p><br>

                                <p><i>“Reading all the posts for a ride [in the Facebook groups]. <b>Everyone has a different format</b> when they post their offers, so it’s super hard.”</i></p><br>

                                <p><i>“There’s no consistency to the postings. The drivers and the riders mix all their posts in one spot on Facebook, none of the locations match up and I <b>often scroll through for a while</b> before I find something I can take.”</i></p><br>

The most frequently used platform is Facebook. Once I tried these experiences out for myself, immediately I recognized several key issues that aligned with our users' pain points when finding a rideshare.</p>

                                <p>Detailing my screens beforehand with wireframes proved to be a huge time saver - in the past I've focused so much on colouring and typography of my designs wherein in the end I'd scrap the design completely and restart with new colours. Forcing myself to keep it black and white for the time being really flushed out my ideas in an iterative means definitely inpsired and drastically influenced the final design of the app. Towards the end I gave myself a good 3-4 days to focus entirely on colour patterns and styling on components I had wireframed previously.</p><br>

                                These are the 3 wireframed iterations I made in the process of designing the Search screen of the app.</p><br>

                                <p>I started by adding some colours to the finalized wireframes. I found myself adjusting the components according to how the colours looked to the user - whether they were overwhelming or made the content difficult to read which I could not observe from simply wireframing. I created my first prototype and created 3 user journeys for key user scenarios within the app:

                                <p>In my design, I applied a great use of various colours and minimalistic elements, allowing the user to focus on getting from start to finish of their goals. We sought to understand the process of finding a ride - inputting needs, receiving results, selecting and booking a ride. When designing, I focused on keeping it within these steps to replicate the user's mental model to make the experience of finding a rideshare as seamless as possible. I established specific branding guidelines such as a defined colour palette that would emphasize our app's message and how elements such as form fields and buttons were meant to be used and viewed. This helped speed up the design process significantly by creating a Sketch Symbol Library of regularly used components.

                                <h3><b>User Scenarios</b></h3><br>

                                <p><b>User Journey 1</b>  <i>Finding my first rideshare</i></p>
                                <p>At this point in the app, we assume the user has just registered, and therefore has no previously saved destinations, past ride, or upcoming rides. On the home screen they will be able to see suggestions on different destinations. An integral part of this app's success is that it gets the job done in as few steps as possible to keep the experience as frictionless as possible.</p><br>

                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/first_ride_flow.png" alt="New user's journey"/>
                                </p><br>

                                <p>Initially the steps began at one 'Start a Ride' button and led to a prompt for the user to select whether they were a rider or a driver. Once I mapped it out, I decided to remove the extra step and gave the users the option to choose up front whether they were looking for a ride or wanted to post one themselves. This way, the primary function sof the app is enhanced as extra screens are taken out in favour of an additional button that can speed up the user's journey.</p><br>

                                <p><b>User Journey 2</b>  <i>Rescheduling a previous trip</i></p>
                                <p></p><br>

                                <p>At this point in the app, the user is familiar with the basic functions of the app and has used it several times. In this journey, the user wants to schedule a trip they've taken before. To speed up this process, the app saves old destinations in their history and allows users to save common destinations.</p><br>

                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/second_ride_flow.png" alt="Scheduling a past rideshare"/>
                                </p><br>

                                <p>Once the user selects a past trip via Saved Destinations or Past Rides in the search screen, the form fields for the Pick up and Drop off cities are populated for the user based on that previous destination. Now they input the date and time they are looking for and proceed to search as usual. This saves the user the time to type out the regions.</p><br>


                                <p><b>User Journey 3</b>  <i>Cancelling a rideshare</i></p><br>
                                <p>If the user no longer wants to take a rideshare they have already booked, they need to cancel it.</p>
