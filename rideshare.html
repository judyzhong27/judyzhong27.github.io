          <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
          <p>So, you’re a student. You want to go home this weekend, give your laundry to mom and eat something other than ramen and sandwich meat. You’ve probably already spent what feels like a quarter of your life searching for a rideshare: chasing down non-responding drivers, unreliable riders, parsing through infinitely long Facebook groups with over 20,000 posts which probably don’t all pertain to you, all the while stressing you can’t get home until you decide to give up and take the bus. </p>
          <p>This is the reality for hundreds of thousands of post-secondary students across the country who lack a single platform for finding and booking rideshares. When it comes to going home or heading back to school, students need a efficient, coherent experience that makes booking and finding rideshares much simpler.</p>

      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px;">
        When it comes to ridesharing, solutions like Uber and Lyft have capitalized on the efficiency of their process. Between instant payments and mobile booking, users are able to arrange rides within minutes.

        What about the others? For those who plan days ahead and travel longer distances, these options can be extremely costly and futile for both the driver and the rider. As an example, students who live anywhere between 30 minutes to 8 hours from home to attend their post-secondary institution. For them, finding rideshares every weekend or perhaps every other weekend is a tedious and frustrating task with the current solutions out there.

    <p style="padding-top: 30px; text-align: center;">Design a mobile platform that allows users to easily find and post rideshares according to specific criteria. At the same time, the process must be simplistic and intuitive to use in 3 steps in which the user can filter search by time, date, pickup/dropoff locations, the number of seats available and book or post their ride.</p>

  <p>Grouping the user comments from Typeform survey and one on one interviews into Information Architecture, Searching/Booking Rides, Overall Experience.

  <h4 style="padding-top: 30px;">MARKET RESEARCH</h4>
  <p>I began by researching the competition - that is, the current solutions that are the most readily available to our consumer base. The most frequently used platform is Facebook, there's also BlaBlaCar which is a widespread, popular option in Europe for city-to-city travel. Once I tried these experiences out for myself, immediately I recognized several key issues that aligned with our users' pain points when finding a rideshare.</p><br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><b>Posts are unfiltered</b> which makes finding a rideshare with specific criteria an extremely tedious task.</p><br>
      <p><b>Cluttered with options</b>. Facebook is optimized for browsing and discovering new content with the side bar of options and a section for recent group photos. Most of these actions don’t pertain to the experience of finding a rideshare at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><b>No consistency in the posts.</b> Individuals could post date, pick up and drop off locations but a different order everytime made it impossible to scan through quicky.</p>
      <p><b>Scrolling takes forever</b> since Facebook includes options like comment, like, and share with significant whitespace for each post, scrolling through quickly is a difficult task with all the other distracting content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><b>No indication of availability.</b> A post, unless regularly updated by the driver/rider, has no indication of whether they’ve found a ride or if the car is full. For users just getting on the platform, there’s no way to know whether messaging them to confirm a ride would result in anything and can be disappointing when it doesn’t.</p>

    <h2>Ideating a solution</h2>
    <h4 style="padding-top:30px;">DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>Keep it simple</b></p>
        <p>Each component within the app is useful and required. This reduces the complexity of extra steps and expedites the user’s journey from start to finish. We value our users’ time - that’s why we created the app.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>Person to person</b></p>
        <p>We emphasize a personalized experience in our app. Users in our app know where they’re going and when they want to go, and we act to facilitate that. We keep our copy conversational and light, guiding our users from start to finish.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>This is for everybody</b></p>
        <p>We target a large demographic, and maintaining inclusivity and legibility within our design is paramount. We design for people - not screens. Enabling an accessible experience gets the greatest number of users where they need to go.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <p><b>Aesthetic design</b></p>
        <p>We turn an otherwise tedious task into a playful experience for our customer base. An aesthetic design enhances the experience and keeps our users engaged.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 style="padding-top:30px;">WIREFRAMES</h4>
    <p>Detailing my screens beforehand with wireframes proved to be a huge time saver - in the past I've focused so much on colouring and typography of my designs wherein in the end I'd scrap the design completely and restart with new colours. Forcing myself to keep it black and white for the time being really flushed out my ideas in an iterative means definitely inpsired and drastically influenced the final design of the app. Towards the end I gave myself a good 3-4 days to focus entirely on colour patterns and styling on components I had wireframed previously.</p>
    <h2 style="padding-top: 30px; text-align: center;">Search screen</h2>
    <div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-5">
					<p class="text-medium medium-margin-top" style="padding-top: 30px;">These are the 3 wireframed iterations I made in the process of designing the Search screen of the app.
					</p>
					<div class="medium-margin-top feature-block select-nudge-engine">
						<h4 style="padding-top: 5px;">Iteration 1</h4>
						<p>A more conversational “Where do you want to go” copy was altered in the hopes of engaging our users better.
<br>
The icons to indicate the number of seats made the screen look more cluttered with an irregular person icon, as well not being easily recognizable.
						</p>
					</div>

          <div class="medium-margin-top feature-block select-nudge-engine">
						<h4 style="padding-top: 5px;">Iteration 2</h4>
						<p>Removing the ability to make Additional Requests for the ride reduced decision fatigue which can lead to decision avoidance. Also, having less criteria to filter by maximizes the search results for the rider.<br><br>

Adding a carousel of past rides the user has taken/driven autofills information into Pickup and Dropoff location, saving time typing - especially if the user takes the same ride everytime.

        <p>The icons for people were not selected well enough to be universally recognized.</p>

      <h4 style="padding-top: 5px;">Iteration 1</h4>
      <p>After doing some testing, the text proved to be too long for users to digest the important content from it, which is the data they entered before seeing the search results. Bolding the text wasn't enough to seperate it from the other copy.</p>

Priortize information that a user should see to click to learn more about that ride and decide whether it is suitable for them.</mark></p>
<img id="image" class="center" src="assets/rideshare-case/cards.png" alt="" style="width:80%; padding: 30px;">

    <h2 style="padding-top:50px;">User scenarios</h2>
    <h4 style="padding-top: 30px;">USER JOURNEY 1: Finding my first rideshare</h4>
    <p>At this point in the app, we assume the user has just registered, and therefore has no previously saved destinations, past ride, or upcoming rides. On the home screen they will be able to see suggestions on different destinations based on location tracking we'll request for at the beginning as part of onboarding. <b>An integral part of this app's success is that it gets the job done in as few steps as possible to keep the experience as frictionless as possible.</b>
</p>
    <img id="image" class="center" src="assets/rideshare-case/journey1.png" alt="" style="width:100%;padding-top:30px;">
    <p>Initially the steps began at one 'Start a Ride' button and led to a prompt for the user to select whether they were a rider or a driver. Once I mapped it out, I decided to remove the extra step and gave the users the option to choose up front whether they were looking for a ride or wanted to post one themselves. This way, the primary function sof the app is enhanced as extra screens are taken out in favour of an additional button that can speed up the user's journey.

</p>

    <h4 style="padding-top: 30px;">USER JOURNEY 2: Searching and booking a previous trip</h4>
    <p>At this point in the app, the user is familiar with the basic functions of the app and has used it several times. In this journey, the user wants to schedule a trip they've taken before. To speed up this process, the app saves old destinations in their history and allows users to save common destinations.

        <h4 style="padding-bottom: 0; padding-top: 10px;">Critique</h4>
        <p>1. To include more information in one screen and reduce scrolling time, I would condense the information in each ride card and shrink the size to save screen real estate

<br><br>2. Add a bottom navigation bar with 3 icons, so the user can use it as a reference point to where they are in the app and switch between screens with reduced clicks</p>
