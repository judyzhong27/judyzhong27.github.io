                                <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
                                <p>When it comes to ridesharing, solutions like Uber and Lyft have capitalized on the efficiency of their app. Between online payments and mobile booking, users can arrange rides within minutes.<br><br>

                            	For users who plan days ahead and travel longer distances, these options can be extremely costly and futile for both driver and rider. In this case, students living 1-6 hours from home to attend school. When it comes to finding rideshares to go home the occasional weekend, it can be a very frustrating and tedious task with the solutions there are now. You might spend hours chasing down non-responding drivers, unreliable riders, parsing through infinitely long Facebook posts, until you give up and take the bus. This is the case for hundreds of thousands of post-secondary students across the country who lack a single medium and established system of doing so: a system which has remained unchanged for years.<br><br>
								
								<!---To begin finding a rideshare, students commonly turn to Facebook groups comprising of thousands of old and new posts of rides from various cities, occurring at a multitude of times, different costs, with no guaranteed availability at any given moment.!--->
                                </p>

                                <h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
                                <p>Students hoping to travel between cities in Canada lack a singular platform that can help them find rides from home to school and vice versa, causing a lot of unnecessary friction when arranging transportation home and results in a lot of wasted time spent on combing through multiple platforms (Facebook, Kijiji, group chats) to find a ride. Many students prefer taking a car over the bus, but this extra strain discourages their search efforts and discourages carpooling. The needed solution should have a simple UI that allows students to quickly search for and confirm rides, include data such as cost, distance, meet up location, car type, and a method of communication for the driver and the ride.</p>
                                <br>

                                <h3><b>Affinity Diagram</b></h3>
                                <p>A siginificant part of my redesign involved removing the use of two menu types: the hamburger menu and the ellipse menu in the top navigation bar and swapping it for a bottom navigation bar for a more modern, less confusing layout. When surveyed, users stumbled on deciding which menu to open first to perform an action with no clear indication on either. I began by creating a list of the actions held within those two menus and placed the information in an affinity diagram. The challenge was being able to keep all the actions in the app for the user, but reconfiguring the work flow to access them through the introduced bottom navigation bar. For this, I had to establish a hierarchy of important actions to determine the number of steps to reach each action.</p><br>

								<h3><b>UI Design</b></h3>
                                <p>I started by adding some colours to the finalized wireframes. I found myself adjusting the components according to how the colours looked to the user - whether they were overwhelming or made the content difficult to read which I could not observe from simply wireframing. I created my first prototype and created 3 user journeys for key user scenarios within the app:
                                </p><br>

                                <p>
                                	<img src="images/" alt="Rideshare app screens"/>
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p>In my design, I applied a great use of various colours and minimalistic elements, allowing the user to focus on getting from start to finish of their goals. We sought to understand the process of finding a ride - inputting needs, receiving results, selecting and booking a ride. When designing, I focused on keeping it within these steps to replicate the user's mental model and make the experience of finding a rideshare as intuitive as possible. I established specific branding guidelines such as a defined colour palette that would emphasize our app's message and how elements such as form fields and buttons were meant to be used and viewed. This helped speed up the design process significantly by creating a Sketch Symbol Library of regularly used components.
