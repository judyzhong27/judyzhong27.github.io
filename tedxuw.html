          <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
          <p>TEDxUW is an annual conference of over 700 attendees hosted at the University of Waterloo. When I was brought on as the 2019 conference's design director, my task was to handle all the branding, website design, and asset creation for the big event.</p>
          <p>The objective of this project is to create a unified, memorable, effective outlook on the TEDxUW conference while working within the constraints of TEDx branding guidelines. We aimed to keep our attendees and applicants in the loop about our event from April to the event date on October 5, 2019.</p>

          <p>This year, TEDxUW is going paperless so to subsitute for physical programs, we'll be creating a web and mobile application for our attendees to refer to during event day</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
  <p style="padding-top: 4vh;">The TEDxUW 2019 theme is Press Play. Press Play means to take responsibility and action in order to seize the day! We want to motivate individuals to go out there and chase what they want and work towards something that provides them with a sense of meaning and peace.</p>
  <p>For the logo, I wanted people who saw it to understand the connection with Press Play through its imagery. I modelled it after a video game controller while keeping the iconic X prominent but with a twist on its symmetry. Once my team and I brainstormed for weeks on a proper logo, this is the one we ultimately chose and set on creating the assets of a modern, recognizable, creative theme around the controller.</p>

    <p>Each year, TEDxUW's design team will create a partnership package for our team to present to potential event supporters. This is the first big branding project our team was tasked with in May. With this project, we outlined the various sections of the package through a editable Google doc with the design team and the sponsorship team to ensure the copy and the sections were placed in a logical order with ample information for our potential sponsors to inquire about.</p>
    <p>For the design, I created fluid shape designs on Procreate to add more brand personality into the package to align with our theme, Press Play. I incorporated several icons as supportive visuals to the content-heavy pages, which also helped to break up the information in more digestible pockets.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px;">Maximize a first time user's understanding of the application's core features through an informative onboarding process to assume greater retention of users.</p>
    <h2 style="padding-top:5%;">Solution</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px;">We took 3 approaches to combined into one coherent, seamless onboarding process for new users.</p>

    <div style="padding-top:10px;"><hr class="yellow" align="left" width="5%" height="8px" color="#ffc700"></div>
    <h2 style="padding-top:20px; font-size: 24px;">1. Full screen walkthrough</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Q: What are the core features of the application? What do they need to know immediately to assess the benefits of using reebee?</p>
    <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">CORE FEATURES</h4>
    <p>To identify the core features of the application, I used a user survey and asked users what features they used most often. Here are the results</p>

        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Browsing flyers</p>
        <p>According to our Firebase data analytics console, 64.7% of daily users use the flyer through opening it from the bookshelf, viewing from a searched item, etc.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Shopping List</p>
        <p>In the past month, 2.1 million items were added to a user’s shopping list</p>

      <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Q: Where are users getting stuck/experiencing a barrier? What are some complex actions in the app?</p>

    <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">IMPORTANT PARTS IN THE APP</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Viewing the details of an item</li>
      <li>Sharing/exporting a shopping list</li>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px; font-size: 24px;">3. Empty state screens</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Q: How can we show our brand personality to new users? How do empty states work to guide users to their next action?</p>

    <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">EMPTY STATES</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Shopping list</li>
      <li>Favourites list</li>
      <li>Search results</li>

    <h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Market research</h2>
    <p style="padding-top: 4vh;">Our main competitors in this space are Flipp and Checkout 51, both of which have established onboarding processes within their applications. To convince my stakeholders to implement one into our app, I analyzed their methods and picked apart the pros/cons of each one and translated the best parts into my final designs. For example, although many studies and testing sessions have shown users tend to skip through in-app walkthroughs, both our competitors use it to their advantage and as a way to reiterate the brand image to users on their first-time user.</p>

    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:4vh;">In order to make the best decision when it came to the final design, I gave my stakeholders and developers a few samples of possible avenues we could explore in the onboarding process. Firstly, to show them how I approached the design process and secondly, to show them all the options there are when it comes to onboarding to prep them for more onboarding design talks later on.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Onboarding in the app</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:4vh;">For the first design of the full screen walkthrough, I created workflow diagrams to determine where the different screens would appear in the application and sent it to the developers.</p>
        <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">FULL SCREEN WALKTHROUGH</h4>
        <p>The full screen walkthrough consists of 5 screens in total. three of these screens are meant to cover the key actions/features of reebee, one for location priming (currently the permission request pops up with no context), and one initial welcome screen. The moment the user signs up for your product/downloads the app, their interest in using it is at an all-time high. To optimize for this, I focused on keeping the complex points (forms, permissions) to post-clicks of the main onboarding process. The whole process can be skipped at any time - but location priming must be read and accepted either through allowing their location or manually entering their postal code before they can continue into the app to make sure it reaches its full functionality.</p>
        <img class="center" src="assets/onboarding-case/onboarding-workflow.png" style="padding-top:30px; width: 100%;">

        <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">TOOLTIPS</h4>
        <p>Tooltips were trickier to integrate into the application. Whereas we knew exactly where the full screen walkthrough would go, we had to have several meetings to discuss optimizing the tooltips' appearing at times the user would need to see them. This means taking into consideration 90% of users usually skip popups, the fact that we wanted them to give them some sense of independence in the app and let them discover it on their own, but also showing them the best way to use reebee. </p><p>For example, a main feature of our application is the ability to add items from a flyer directly into a shopping list but after looking at the data, we realized only about 25% of users actually use this feature. Of course, this could be due to personal preference but to target users who simply didn't understand/know about the functionality: How do we place the tooltips in a way that will lightly push this behaviour so users can get the most out of their experience?</p>
        <p>Additionally, the onboarding process was initially thought to displayed only for first-time users. However, with realizing that only 25% of users were adding flyer items, we contemplated on adding the tooltips in now for existing users who were part of those 75%. Here is the result of those two workflows that I sent over to my customer success manager and the developers on the team to sort out the logic of the process.</p>

        <h2>Initial sketches</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:4vh;">After meeting with my team about the different designs I wireframed, we chose to start with the full screen designs as an MVP to implement it into the app as soon as possible. Once we decided on the core features of the app, I started on the sketches using Procreate on my iPad. A big part of the project was also identifying reebee's voice and branding to customers and the sort of personality we wanted our brand associated with. Working with the graphic designers, we identified design principles of reebee's brand.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of thousands of Canadian households rely on reebee to save on their household items. reebee helps these household save thousands of dollars per year and live more organized, productive lifestyles that require an established foundation of trust with our customers.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">Conversational</p>
            <p>As our company grows in downloads and size, keeping that personable relationship with our user base becomes more difficult to maintain. We want to ensure that our app feels relaxed and conversational, giving users the impression of a company that values their interests and input.</p>

            <p>Our user base consists of individuals aged 15-80 - maybe of which occupy the 35+ demographic that have reported frequently their technological limits prevent them from using reebee to its full potential.

        <h2>Copywriting process</h2>
          <p style="padding-top:4vh;">Copywriting was a very collaborative, important part of the onboarding design process. It needed as much deliberation as the design decisions for the UI. These screens show how I approached thinking through the copy so it’s clear, concise, helpful, and contextual.</p>
          <p>I created an excel doc and compiled three different versions of the copy - one written by our marketing team, one by our stakeholders, and one by myself and the dev team lead and put them side by side for comparison.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 10vh;">Engaging users with imagery</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:4vh;">The use of imagery was a strong component in creating the onboarding screens. According to the biophilia effect, associating text with connections to nature can be very relaxing and engaging to people as they are more trusting and drawn to proper uses of coloring and visuals. Since the goal of the onboarding process is to encourage users to read about our features before entering the application, we wanted to keep users on the onboarding screens interpreting and reading the information as much as possible. I spent some time on Adobe Illustrator creating the illustrations around reebee's branding personality and key reebee blue to breathe more life into the app experience.</p>
        <img class="center" src="assets/onboarding-case/onboarding-imagery.png" alt="Illustrations of onboarding visuals" style="width:80%; padding-top: 10vh;">

          <h2 style="padding-top:10vh;">Final walkthrough design</h2>
            <p style="padding-top:5vh;">As part of another reebee design project I was working on, I knew the design of the application might be changing drastically so incorporating screenshots/mockups of the current app design in the screens which is a common design practice wouldn't work in the long-run. By using imagery that aligns with our consistent reebee branding, I emphasized the scalability of the design to my stakeholders.</p>
