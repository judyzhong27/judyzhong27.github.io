          <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
          <p>As the reebee app grows in downloads and competitors enter the market, it's becoming increasingly important to start identifying a voice for the brand and to give our users a better experience by breaking down and highlighting important actions in the app.</p>
          <p>We aimed to emphasize the value proposition of the app through a three step process: a full screen walkthrough, in-app tooltips, and creating more visual empty state screens.</p>

      <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px;">Without any ownership of the onboarding strategy on reebee's platforms, its existing one has become outdated and does not reflect new features or modern design guidelines. A structured onboarding process is an extremely useful feature of an application when it comes to user retention.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Goal</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px; text-align: center;">Increase the reebee app's user retention rates by building stronger relationships with new users, while showcasing more brand personality.</p>

    <!-- <h2 style="padding-top: 3%;">How we got there</h2>

    <p style="padding-bottom: 3%; padding-top: 3%;">Think about a product you love. Is it digital? Physical? Now, define its "value" to me. Exactly what keeps you coming back, and it could be a million features or microinteractions or it could be one. The important part is that there is that one, and that it is definable and recognizable by most people. Now, can you remember what it felt like the first time you ever used it? Were you confused? Lost? Delighted? <br><br>That's where onboarding comes in. Every product, whether physical or digital, evokes some impression from the user. By grasping that and showcasing your product's value proposition, you've got the secret sauce that will keep your retention rate high. How do we get there? Here's my story - how we went from numbers in the data and stakeholder support to a 3 month, iterative process where we brought in co-workers and stakeholders from various teams to collaborate all with the combined goal of bringing that "aha" moment to our users quicker and educating them to keep customers informed and hungry for more.

            <p><b>Absence of location priming</b></p>
            <p>One of the best practices in user experience is keeping your process as transparent as possible where you can. Upon entry, users are asked immediately for their location, which is needed to locate flyers that apply to their area so to maximize the experience.</p>
          </div>

            <p><b>Lack of brand personality</b></p>

      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 3%;">Key considerations</h2>
      <div class="row" style="padding-top: 3%;">
        <div class='col-sm-4'>
          <p><b>1. User demographic</b></p>
          <p>40% of our users are millenials, while 52% of them have children under 18<br><br>

            1.2 million active users  in the last 3 months</p>
        </div>
        <div class='col-sm-4'>
          <p><b>2. Preconceptions about digital flyers</b></p>
          <p>Many of our new users are discovering online flyers for the first time, so we can assume they are unfamiliar with navigating them in a digital format rather than holding the papers in their hand (user mental model)</p>
        </div>
        <div class='col-sm-4'>
          <p><b>3. Onboarding design context</b></p>
          <p>Reducing the complexity while emphasizing the value proposition consistently is key to a good onboarding process. Avoid: cognitive overload, multiple steps = disengaged users, unclear/unhelpful copy, no option to skip, account creation (in the first steps)</p>

        <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 30px;">As the sole designer on this product, I researched various onboarding methodologies and best practices to seek direction at the early stages. Much of what I read was centered around bridging the gap between acquiring new users and turning them into highly engaged customers. Ideally, the user sees the product as a solution, and engages directly with the brand.<br><br>In the end, we approached the problem as a 3-part solution combined into one coherent, seamless onboarding process.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px; font-size: 24px;">1. Full screen walkthrough</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Q: What are the core features of the application? What do they need to know immediately to assess the benefits of using reebee?</p>
    <p>To identify the core features of the application, I used a user survey and asked users what features they used most often. Here are the results</p>

        <p>According to our Firebase data analytics console, 64.7% of daily users use the flyer through opening it from the bookshelf, viewing from a searched item, etc.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px; font-size: 24px;">3. Empty state screens</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Q: How can we show our brand personality to new users? How do empty states work to guide users to their next action?</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Market research</h2>
    <p style="padding-top: 4vh;">Our main competitors in this space are Flipp and Checkout 51, both of which have established onboarding processes within their applications. To convince my stakeholders to implement one into our app, I analyzed their methods and picked apart the pros/cons of each one and translated the best parts into my final designs. For example, although many studies and testing sessions have shown users tend to skip through in-app walkthroughs, both our competitors use it to their advantage and as a way to reiterate the brand image to users on their first-time user.</p>

    <h2>Initial sketches</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:4vh;">After meeting with my team about the different designs I wireframed, we chose to start with the full screen designs as an MVP to implement it into the app as soon as possible. Once we decided on the core features of the app, I started on the sketches using Procreate on my iPad. A big part of the project was also identifying reebee's voice and branding to customers and the sort of personality we wanted our brand associated with. Working with the graphic designers, we identified design principles of reebee's brand.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:4vh;">Wireframing</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:4vh;">In order to make the best decision when it came to the final design, I gave my stakeholders and developers a few samples of possible avenues we could explore in the onboarding process. Firstly, to show them how I approached the design process and secondly, to show them all the options there are when it comes to onboarding to prep them for more onboarding design talks later on.</p>

        <h2>Onboarding strategy</h2>
        <h4 style="padding-top:4vh;">FULL SCREEN WALKTHROUGH</h4>
        <p>The full screen walkthrough consists of 5 screens in total. three of these screens are meant to cover the key actions/features of reebee, one for location priming (currently the permission request pops up with no context), and one initial welcome screen. The moment the user signs up for your product/downloads the app, their interest in using it is at an all-time high. <br><br>To optimize for this, I focused on keeping the complex points (forms, permissions) to post-clicks of the main onboarding process. The whole process can be skipped at any time - but location priming must be shown at least once and accepted either through allowing their location or manually entering their postal code before they can continue into the app.</p>

        <h4 style="padding-top:8%;">TOOLTIPS</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Tooltips were trickier to integrate into the application. Alternatively, we knew exactly where the full screen walkthrough would go, but for tooltips we had several meetings to discuss optimizing the tooltips' appearance at specific points in the app.<br><br>We had to be mindful that 90% of users tend to skip popups, and we wanted them to give a sense of control and discoverability, but also nudging them towards the best way to use reebee.</p>
        <p>For example, a main feature of our application is the ability to add items from a flyer directly into a shopping list but after looking at the data, we realized only about 25% of users actually use this feature. Of course, this could be due to personal preference but to target users who simply didn't understand/know about the functionality: How do we place the tooltips in a way that will lightly push this behaviour so users can get the most out of their experience?</p>
        <p>Additionally, the onboarding process was initially thought to displayed only for first-time users. However, with realizing that only 25% of users were adding flyer items, we contemplated on adding the tooltips in now for existing users who were part of those 75%. <br><br>Below is the result of two workflows that I sent over to my customer success manager and the developers on the team to sort out the logic of the process.</p>

        <h2>Copywriting process</h2>
          <p style="padding-top:4vh;">Copywriting was a very collaborative, important part of the onboarding design process. It needed as much deliberation as the design decisions for the UI. These screens show how I approached thinking through the copy so itâ€™s clear, concise, helpful, and contextual.</p>
          <p>I created an Google sheet and compiled three different versions of the copy - one written by our marketing team, one by our stakeholders, and one by myself and the dev team lead and put them side by side for comparison. This way, more teams in the company felt more involved in the feature building and we incorporated more opinions into our final design.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 10vh;">Engaging users with imagery</h2>
        <p style="padding-top:4vh;">The use of imagery was a strong component in creating the onboarding screens. According to the biophilia effect, associating text with connections to nature can be very relaxing and engaging to people as they are more trusting and drawn to proper uses of coloring and visuals.</p>
        <p>Since the goal of the onboarding process is to encourage users to read about our features before entering the application, we wanted to keep users on the onboarding screens interpreting and reading the information as much as possible. I spent some time on Adobe Illustrator creating the illustrations around reebee's branding personality and key reebee blue to breathe more life into the app experience.</p>

          <h2>Final walkthrough design</h2>
            <p style="padding-top:5vh;">As part of another reebee design project I was working on, I knew the design of the application might be changing drastically so incorporating screenshots/mockups of the current app design in the screens which is a common design practice wouldn't work in the long-run. <br><br>By using imagery that aligns with our consistent reebee branding, I emphasized the scalability of the design to my stakeholders.<br><br>Available now on reebee on iOS and Android.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p style="padding-top: 3%;">Throughout my co-op term with reebee, I had to stay persistent in advocating for the design of the application and to keep me in the loop for product changes. As the only designer, I found receiving feedback directly on my design was difficult to find and often consulted with developers and the co-founders on my decisions for validation. Going into this project, I knew my designs had to be accompanied by lots of support and explanation to make sure everyone understood the reasoning behind specific stylistic choices or UX flows.</p>
    <p>Onboarding involved getting to know the app better and understanding what users were getting confused on/were annoyed at learning. This was my first project coming into reebee and learning it as quickly as possible delayed my progress at the beginning of the project.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:5vh;">Current progress</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:5vh;">The first part of this project, the full screen walkthrough, is implemented on iOS and Android in August 2019 and is currently live on the reebee application, available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reebee-save-money-with-flyers/id558297215">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reebee.reebee&hl=en_CA">Google Play</a>. The tooltips and empty state screens and is expected to be complete by the end of September 2019. A few final things we are ironing out are ensuring it follows iOS and Android interface guidelines for their respective platforms, which has been an ongoing challenge for me during this work term.</p>

    <h4 style="padding-top:2%;">KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS</h4>

      <h2 style="padding-top:5%;">What's next?</h2>
      <p style="padding-top: 4vh;">In the future, we plan to do more user walkthroughs to identify more pain points the user is experiencing and creating tooltips in response that can help them learn those tasks faster. In another <a href="system.html" target="_blank">project I was working on</a>, we began work on a design system to document notification and tooltip design intended to introduce new features to our existing users.</p>
