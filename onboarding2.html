        <h6>During my internship at Reebee, I took on my first project as the lead designer creating an onboarding strategy for their digital product. <br><br>

There were big changes on the roadmap for reebee and an onboarding process was needed to educate our users to reduce complexity and emphasize key features.</h6>
      <div>
        <h4 class="case-content">ABOUT REEBEE</h4>
        <h6>Reebee, based in Kitchener, Ontario is redefining the way we shop. Their platform has features such as browsing digital flyers, creating shopping lists, and searching for the best deals on household items and groceries.</h6>
      </div>

      <h4 class="case-content">WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</h4>
      <h6>Having an onboarding process that reduces the complexity of your application is one the most crucial factors for long-term growth of a business. Nowadays, users want to be met with simplistic functionality of products that will improve their lives and help them meet their goals without much effort.

<br><br>Our product was intended to save millions of users money and encourage them to shop more efficiently, but our poor retention rates told us our design wasnâ€™t conveying that value proposition effectively to users.</h6>

        <h4>WHAT DO WE NEED TO LEARN?</h4>
        <h6 class="case-content">After researching about onboarding design and the various methods used in industry, I decided to shape my research around two questions:</h6>

        <h6 class="case-content">1. What value does reebee bring to customers?<br>
                                2. What steps does a user have to take before they convert?</h6>
        <h6 class="case-content"><b>Research Methods</b></h6>
        <h6>
          1. Surveys<br>
            2. App reviews<br>
            3. Market research
        </h6>
        <h6 class="case-content">Through the in-app survey we distributed, we aimed to learn what were some of the core features our existing users found most useful in reebee and sought to highlight those as part of our value proposition. Here were the results of 67 user responses.</h6>
        <img src="assets/onboarding-case2/core-features-results.png">
        <h6 class="case-content">Analyzing the data, we discovered that Reebee's top 3 features were the ability to browse digital flyers, create shopping lists, and search for the best deals on items. With this information, our strategy centred around presenting these functions up front and center to build up user interest.</h6>
        <h6 class="case-content">To gather more qualitative data to support our numbers, I read through hundreds of Reebee app store reviews. Many of our reviews centred around the same 3 features plus additional interactions users were liking: the functionality of adding flyer items to a shopping list directly, and viewing the details of a particular flyer product.</h6>
        <img src="assets/">

        <h6 class="case-content"><b>Market research</b></h6>
        <h6>I conducted market research on other onboarding strategies used by our competitors to identify key features of their apps and to understand better the needs of our users, and in the end, develop a more effective strategy.</h6>
